HW 1: 

This assignment gives you hands-on experience with text represen- tations and the use of text classification for sentiment analysis. Sen- timent analysis is extensively used to study customer behaviors using reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for marketing and costumer service applications. The assign- ment is accompanied with a Jupyter Notebook to structure your code. Please submit a PDF report which contains answers to the questions in the assignment and also print the completed Jupyter Notebook in PDF format (just submit one PDF file by merging your written answer and the completed Jupyter notebook). On your completed Jupyter notebook, please print the requested values, too. Additionally, you also need to submit an executable .py file which when run, generates the requested numerical outputs in the assignment. We need the .py file to check overlap between codes to detect plagiarism.
